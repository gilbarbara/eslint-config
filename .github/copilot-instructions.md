# Copilot Instructions

## Test Fixtures

Files in `test/fixtures/` are intentional ESLint violation examples used to test that rules correctly detect issues. Do not suggest fixes for:
- Unused variables/imports
- Missing function calls
- Deprecated APIs

These violations are expected and required for testing.
